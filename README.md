This is the new, improved and better looking frontend for HedgeDoc 2.0. Our goal is to recreate the current frontend in
react and to improve it.

## Preparation

You need at least Node 14 (we recommend Node 16) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## Development mode

1. Clone this repo (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/hedgedoc/react-client.git hedgedoc-react-client`)
2. Go inside the repo (e.g. `cd hedgedoc-react-client`)
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Either run
    - `yarn dev` - Calls only mocked version of the api. Doesn't need a HedgeDoc backend.
    - `yarn start:for-real-backend` -
      Expects [a HedgeDoc backend server](https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/tree/develop) running
      under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))

This should run the app in the development mode and open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Tests

#### Unit

Unit testing is done via jest.

1. Run `yarn test`

#### End2End

We use [cypress](https://cypress.io) for e2e tests.

1. Start the frontend with `yarn dev:test` in dev test mode or build a test build with `yarn build:test` which you can
   serve with `yarn serve:build`
   Don't use the regular start/build command, or the tests will fail!
2. Run `yarn cy:open` to open the cypress test loader
3. Choose your browser and test
4. Let the tests run

### Bundle analysis

You can inspect the generated production-bundle files to look for optimization issues.

1. Run `yarn analyze`
2. Open the generated `.next/server/analyze/server.html` in your favourite browser

## Production mode

1. Clone this repo (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/hedgedoc/react-client.git hedgedoc-react-client`)
2. Go inside the repo (e.g. `cd hedgedoc-react-client`)
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Run `yarn build`

This will build the app in production mode and save it into the `.next` folder. The production build is optimized for
best performance, minimized and the filenames include a hash value of the content. Don't edit them by hand!

You can run the production build using the built-in server with `yarn start`.

## UI Test

Curious about the new look and feel? We provide a demo of the new UI on [hedgedoc.dev](https://hedgedoc.dev). This version uses mocked data and has no data persistence.

The UI test is hosted by [netlify](https://netlify.com). Please check their [privacy policy](https://netlify.com/privacy) as well as [ours](https://hedgedoc.org/privacy-policy).
